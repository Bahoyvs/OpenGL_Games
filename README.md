# OpenGL_Games

These are my projects that I made for my CTIS 164 Technical Mathematics with Programming course.
You have to install FreeGlut in order to run my programs.
All of the code is written in C language even though the file extensions are ".cpp".

* Homework 1
   * The camera can switch between the thermal camera and the normal camera with arrow keys.
   * You can destroy tanks with mouse click.
   * Aiming Cursor resets its position when the mouse leaves the designated area and can lock onto the tank.

* Homework 2
   * Show kill number
   * Base can take a damage and if base health reach the 0 game end 
   * Display base health
   * Cool explotion effect
   * Bomb drop time depend on the distance between plane and target
   * Target Cursor never goes to base
   * Tanks disappear again immediately after entering the base

* Homework 3
   * Rocket launcher follows the mouse position
   * Visualized locking system
   * Thanks to the locking system, rocket firing does not occur before the rocket launcher is locked to the plane.
   * After the rocket launcher locks the plane, the rocket launcher's movable part, instead of following the mouse position, follows the plane.
   * Locking system shows the time remaining to lock onto the plane
   * Realistic optimized smoke effect
   * Cool explosion effect
